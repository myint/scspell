Base dicts tests

    $ T=tests/basedicts

With all the dictionaries, clean run:

    $ $SCSPELL --override-dictionary $T/dictionary \
    >     --use-builtin-base-dict \
    >     --base-dict $T/base-dictionary-1 --base-dict $T/base-dictionary-2 \
    >     $T/testfile

Leave out everything but the override dictionary

    $ $SCSPELL --override-dictionary $T/dictionary $T/testfile
    tests/basedicts/testfile:1: 'hoth' not found in dictionary (from token 'hoth')
    tests/basedicts/testfile:1: 'apple' not found in dictionary (from token 'apple')
    tests/basedicts/testfile:1: 'bakingsoda' not found in dictionary (from token 'bakingsoda')
    tests/basedicts/testfile:2: 'perfectly' not found in dictionary (from token 'perfectly')
    tests/basedicts/testfile:3: 'also' not found in dictionary (from token 'also')
    tests/basedicts/testfile:3: 'yavin' not found in dictionary (from token 'yavin')
    [1]

Add in just the first base dict

    $ $SCSPELL --override-dictionary $T/dictionary \
    >     --base-dict $T/base-dictionary-1 $T/testfile
    tests/basedicts/testfile:1: 'apple' not found in dictionary (from token 'apple')

Filter out builtin-base-dict from base-dictionary-2
    $ $SCSPELL --override-dictionary $T/base-dictionary-2 \
    >     --use-builtin-base-dict --filter-out-base-dicts
    $ diff -u $T/base-dictionary-2 $T/base-dictionary-2.filtered
